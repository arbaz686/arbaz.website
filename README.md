## Contributing

As it is my personal website, I'm not really looking for feature requests for this project. I would, however, love to get bug reports, especially about accessibility issues, browser rendering inconsistencies, performance bottlenecks, and general usability criticism.

The best way to submit these issues is using this repo's [Issue tracker](https://github.com/arbaz686/arbaz.website/issues). Please make sure you read the contributing guidelines before doing so!
